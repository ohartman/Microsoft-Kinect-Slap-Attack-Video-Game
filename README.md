# Slapattack/Slapkinect Video Game
Created using the processing programming language with help from
the OpenKinect project.
*Slap-Kinect requires a Microsoft Kinect device!
*Slap-Attack only requires a webcam!

# Try out either game!
Slapkinect utilizes motion controls so that you can slap a face in the 
virtual world! Slapattack allows users to turn any sort of brightly colored
object, such as a pen or glowstick, into a virtual slapping webcam!

# Troubleshoot
Make sure that your object is a bright color and stands out against other
colors in the video when playing Slap-Attack
When initially starting Slap-Kinect, make sure to clear the area in front
of the Kinect completely, a little message will pop up when the sensors are
ready.
